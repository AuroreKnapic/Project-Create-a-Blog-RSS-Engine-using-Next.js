The goal is to build an app where people can view the latest posts from a list of blogs we selected, people can also add a new blog.
store the data using Airtable as backend  and to approve the blogs proposed by our users.
The list of blog posts will be fetched from the blog posts RSS/Atom feeds.
And here comes into play one feature of Next.js that will be at the core of our app: the home page and the form pages will be static pages, generated at build time, but at the same time our API will be handled by the server-side code.

This is a project made when following https://thejsbootcamp.com/

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
